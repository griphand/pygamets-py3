"""
Input events reader.

Collect events reading raw events pipe /dev/input/event0

Motivation:

  The PS/2 emulated events available at /dev/input/mouse0 have
  wrong position information if touch screen is used. So the pygame
  relying on such events works incorrectly unless used under X-windows
  system which implements its own raw events processing routine.
